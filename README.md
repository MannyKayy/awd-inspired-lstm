# awd-inspired-lstm [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyUGJfyYKdvPi6J7ZlsxPg9E_ppZG1xU)
This repository contains an implementation of a Language Model using state-of-the-art techniques also seen in the current state-of-the-art AWD-LSTM

This model was built as part of a project in the course 02456 Deep Learning @ DTU - Technical University of Denmark
+ This code was originally forked from the [PyTorch word level language modeling example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model) and is heavily inspired by the original AWD-LSTM implementation [LSTM and QRNN Language Model Toolkit](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm)

+ The notebook is available on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyUGJfyYKdvPi6J7ZlsxPg9E_ppZG1xU) and in this github repo, but instructions to run will only be given for the google colab version, for which we give instructions to train a word level language models over the Penn Treebank (PTB)

## Software Requirements

Python 3 and PyTorch 0.4 are required for the current codebase.
